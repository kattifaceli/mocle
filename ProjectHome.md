MOCLE is a software that performs data clustering based on different measures of similarity between these data. Focusing in performance, object-oriented concepts, usability, readability and standardization of the code. Our goal is develop a well structured and solid software that can be easily expanded. This framework (MOCLE) allows the automatic computation of various important activities of the cluster analysis: applying various algorithms conceptually differents  with parameter settings varied and combines the resulting partitions selects the best in relation to various aspects of quality of the partitions . Ie based on a data group that does not have any relation to each other initially, MOCLE takes measures of similarity to analyze the similarities how similar are the data are thus being able to group them based on several measures of similarity.
